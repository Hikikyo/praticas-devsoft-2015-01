## How to: complete a week's exercises

1. Go to the directory of any week and exercise you want to complete. For example, this is the page for __Week 1__, __Exercise 1__: https://github.com/infosimples/praticas-devsoft-2015-01/tree/master/week1/exercises/w1-e1

2. In that directory, you will always find a file named `wX-eX.md`. This is the exercise description. Start here and follow all instructions.

  NOTE: Any given directory may also contain the following files:
  - `wX-eX-spec.rb`: this is the exercise's automated testing script. Usually, you won't need to read or modify this file, you will just execute it, but feel free to "peek behind the curtains" :)
  - `wX-eX-submit.sh`: this is a script to submit your solution so it can be graded. Same observation as above.

3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) for all exercises.

4. Mission accomplished. Congratulations!

# Exercise W2-E2

1. Make sure you are on `u_NUSP/b1` branch, created on the previous exercise (W2-E1).

2. Open the repository's directory with the Sublime Text editor.

  __Hint__: use the `subl {path}` command to do that, replacing "{path}" with the directory you want to open.

3. Inside the `drinks` directory, create a file called `milkshake.md` and add a milkshake recipe to it. Use your preferred milkshake recipe.

4. Remove the `cappuccino.md` file (both the actual file and also from Git).

5. Commit your changes from steps (3) and (4). Use the following commit message:

  ```
  Add milkshake recipe; remove cappuccino recipe.
  ```

5. Run the following:
  ```
  $ rspec /home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week2/exercises/w2-e2/w2-e2-spec.rb
  ```

8. Push the branch to GitHub. This push should update the branch `u_NUSP/b1`.

  __Hint__: you can use the `git push` command full syntax:
  ```
  git push {remote} {local_branch}:{master_branch}`
  ```
  replacing "{remote}", "{local_branch}" and "{master_branch}" with the appropriate values.

  __IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER. PUSHING TO MASTER WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE POINTS.__

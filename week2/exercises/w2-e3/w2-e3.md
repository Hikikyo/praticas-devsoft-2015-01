# Exercise W2-E3

1. Make sure you have no uncommited changes.

2. Checkout to the `improve_brownie_recipe` branch.

3. Create a new branch named `u_NUSP/b2`.

4. Checkout to the branch `u_NUSP/b2`.

5. Merge the branch `improve_brownie_recipe` into your current branch (`u_NUSP/b2`).

6. Since both branches have made conflicting changes to the brownie.md file, the automatic merge will fail and you will have to manually resolve the conflict. Assume the most recent commit is correct.

7. After the conflict is resolved, add the files and commit your changes to complete the merge operation. Use exactly the following commit message:
```
Fix brownie recipe.
```

8. Run the following:
  ```
  $ rspec /home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week2/exercises/w2-e1/w2-e3-spec.rb
  ```

9. Push your changes to GitHub. This push should create a remote branch called `u_NUSP/b2`. __DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER__.

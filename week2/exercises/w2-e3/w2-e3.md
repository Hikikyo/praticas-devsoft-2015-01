# Exercise W2-E3

1. Make sure you have no uncommited changes in your repository.

  __Hint:__ use the `git status` command to do that.

2. Checkout the `improve_brownie_recipe` branch.

3. Create a new branch named `u_NUSP/b2`.

4. Checkout the branch `u_NUSP/b2`.

5. We will now merge the branch `master` into the current branch (`u_NUSP/b2`), to keep them in sync. To do that, run `git merge master`.

6. Since both branches have made conflicting changes to the `brownie.md` file, the automatic merge will fail and you will have to manually resolve some conflicts.

  __HOW TO MANUALLY RESOLVE CONFLICTS:__ when a merge fails, Git will change the conflicted file (in this case, `brownie.md`) and add marks to tell you the parts of the file that each commit changed. You should edit this file in a text editor (eg, Sublime Text) until the file looks like a unified, consistent file.

  __NOTE__: when solving the conflicts, you usually have to use your common sense. In this case, it helps to know that one of the commits was trying to change formatting and fix typos, while the other one was changing ingredients and adding some comments. You will have to merge this changes into a consistent file.

7. After updating the `brownie.md` file, you should `git add` the file that had conflicts and commit your changes, This will complete the merge operation. In this "merge commit", use the following commit message:

  ```
  Fix brownie recipe.
  ```

8. Finally, run the automated tests to check your work:

  ```
  $ rspec /home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week2/exercises/w2-e3/w2-e3-spec.rb
  ```

8. Push the branch to GitHub. This push should update the branch `u_NUSP/b2`.

  __Hint__: you can use the `git push` command full syntax:
  ```
  git push {remote} {local_branch}:{remote_branch}`
  ```
  replacing "{remote}", "{local_branch}" and "{remote_branch}" with the appropriate values.

  __IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER. PUSHING TO MASTER WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE POINTS.__

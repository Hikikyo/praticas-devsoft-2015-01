# Exercise for Week 2

## Setup Instructions

1. Open a Terminal and go to directory of the course's GitHub repository. If you are using the course's VM, the directory is `~/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo`.

2. Inside that directory, run `git fetch origin` to download the most recent changes.

3. Now, run `git merge origin/master` to apply the new changes.

4. Verification: the directory  `~/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week2/exercises` should now exist.

__NOTE__: when inside the Terminal, `~` is just a shortcut for `/home/{username}`, or, in our case, `/home/ubuntu`.

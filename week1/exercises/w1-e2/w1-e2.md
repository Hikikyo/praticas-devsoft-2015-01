# Exercise W1-E2

## Instructions

1. Open a new Terminal window.

2. Go to `/home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week1/exercises/w1-e2`.

  NOTE: the next steps assume this is your working directory. If you change directory using `cd`, you might need to adapt those steps accordingly.

3. Create a new, empty file in this directory named `w1-e2-solution.sh`.

4. Write, in the file you just created, a _shell script_ (that is, a sequence of Unix commands) that downloads the file http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/intro-linux.html and outputs the following:
  
  ```
  Linux: X
  linux: Y
  linux (case-insensitive): Z
  ```
  
  Where X, Y and Z should be replaced as follows:
  - X = number of occurrences of the term "Linux"
  - Y = number of occurrences of the term "linux"
  - Z = number of occurrences of the term "linux" in a case-insensitive comparison, that is, considering any combination of uppercase and lowercase characters.
  
  Execution example:
  ```
  $ ./w1-e2-solution.sh
  Linux:    100
  linux:    2
  linux (case-insensitive):   109
  ```
  
6. Run the automated tests on your solution:
  ```
  $ rspec w1-e2-spec.rb
  ```

  The command above will run a script that performs automated tests on your solution.
  If your script does not perform as expected, errors will be reported and you should fix them before proceeding to the next step.

7. Run the following command to submit your exercise:
  ```
  # IMPORTANT: replace "XXXXXX" with your N.USP.
  $ ./w1-e2-submit.sh XXXXXX
  ```

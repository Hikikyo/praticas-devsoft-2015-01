# Exercise W1-E3

## Instructions

1. Open a new Terminal window.

2. Go to `/home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week1/exercises/w1-e3`.

  NOTE: the next steps assume this is your working directory. If you change directory using `cd`, you might need to adapt those steps accordingly.

3. Create a new, empty file in this directory named `w1-e3-solution.sh`.

4. Write, in the file you just created, a _shell script_ (that is, a sequence of Unix commands) that
downloads the file from a URL passed as the first argument to the script and prints the number of occurrences of the term passed as the second argument. Use case-insensitive comparison.
  
  Note this exercise is a simple generalization of the previous exercise, using shell script parameters.

  Execution example:
  ```
  $ ./w1-e3-solution.sh "http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" ibm
  ibm:    10
  ```
  
6. Run the automated tests on your solution:
  ```
  $ rspec w1-e3-spec.rb
  ```

  The command above will run a script that performs automated tests on your solution.
  If your script does not perform as expected, errors will be reported and you should fix them before proceeding to the next step.

7. Run the following command to submit your exercise:
  ```
  # IMPORTANT: replace "XXXXXX" with your N.USP.
  $ ./w1-e3-submit.sh XXXXXX
  ```
